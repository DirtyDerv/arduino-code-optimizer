# ACO - Arduino Code Optimizer
Reduce the memory usage of your Arduino sketch up to 90% by using the [Arduino Port Manipulation](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/PortManipulation).

All references to the ports used by the microcontroller can be found in its datasheet, e.g. [Atmega328P](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-7810-Automotive-Microcontrollers-ATmega328P_Datasheet.pdf).

**Attention: the use of this tool on your sketch could make it to lose portability between the different Arduino microcontrollers**
